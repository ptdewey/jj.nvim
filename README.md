# jj.nvim

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚠️

> **Note:** This project is pre-v1. Breaking changes may occur in the configuration, API, and features until v1.0.0 is released.

`jj.nvim` brings [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) to your editor. Execute jj commands directly from Neovim with rich UI integration, custom editors for commit messages, interactive diff viewing from the log, live rebasing with preview, status browsing with file restoration, and one-click PR/MR opening. It's jj for Neovim without leaving your workflow.

## Enhanced integrations

Here are some cool features you can do with jj.nvim:

### View change summary from the log buffer

Quickly preview the files changed in any revision without leaving the log:

- `<S-k>` - Show a tooltip with the revision's changed files
- `<S-k>` - To enter the tooltip buffer

From the summary view, you can:

- `<S-d>` - Diff the file under cursor at that revision
- `<CR>` - Edit the revision and open the file
- `<S-CR>` - Edit the revision (ignoring immutability) and open the file

![Summary-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/summary.gif)

### Diff any change

You can diff any change in your log history by pressing `<S-d>` on its line or on a summary file change. This opens the configured diff backend for the revision under the cursor.

> [!NOTE]
> Integrates with your preferred diff plugin or uses your native jj diff config. See [Diff Module](#diff-module).

![Diff-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/diff-log.gif)

### Diff revision history

You can now open a history-aware diff between two revisions:

- In the log buffer, visually select multiple revisions and press `<S-h>`
- `jj.nvim` uses the first and last selected revisions as the range boundaries
- `diffview` opens `DiffviewFileHistory` for that range
- `codediff` opens `CodeDiff history` for that range
- The `native` backend currently shows a warning because history mode is not supported there yet

This is useful when you want to inspect the evolution of a stack or compare a revision range with commit history preserved instead of showing a single plain diff.

### Change the log revset from the log buffer

You can change which revset the log buffer is displaying without closing and reopening it:

- `<C-r>` - Prompt for a new revset and reload the log buffer with it

This is useful for quickly narrowing the log to something like `main::@`, `mutable()`, or any other revset while staying in the same log view.

### Describe a change

You can describe any change directly from the log buffer:

- `d` - Describe the revision under cursor using your configured editor

### Edit changes

Jumping up and down your log history ?

In your log output press `CR` in a line to directly edit a `mutable` change.
If you are sure what you are doing press `S-CR` (Shift Enter) to edit an `immutable` change.
![Edit-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/edit-log.gif)

### Create new changes from the log buffer

You can create new changes directly from the log buffer with multiple options:

- `n` - Create a new change branching off the revision under the cursor
- `<C-n>` - Create a new change after the revision under the cursor
- `<S-n>` - Create a new change after while ignoring immutability constraints

### Undo/Redo from the log buffer

You can undo/redo changes directly from the log buffer:

- `<S-u>` - Undo the last operation
- `<S-r>` - Redo the last undone operation

### Abandon changes from the log buffer

You can abandon changes directly from the log buffer, works in visual mode to abandon multiple changes:

- `a` - Abandon the revision under the cursor

### Fetch and push from the log buffer

You can fetch and push directly from the log buffer:

- `f` - Fetch from remote
- `<S-p>` - Push a bookmark through the picker
- `p` - Push bookmark of revision under cursor to remote

### Manage bookmarks from the log buffer

- `b` - Create a new bookmark or move an existing one to the revision under cursor
  - Select from existing bookmarks to move them
  - Or create a new bookmark at that revision
- `B` - Delete a bookmark at the revision under cursor
  - If multiple bookmarks are present, select from the list or delete all of them

### Manage tags from the log buffer

- `<S-t>` - Create a new tag on the revision under cursor

Deleting and pushing tags (for colocated repositories) is also supported and changes are reflected if the log buffer is open. Set up some keybinds and you're good to go, please see [here](#tag-management-command-options).

### Squash changes from the log buffer

Enter an interactive squash mode to squash one or more changes into a destination:

- `s` - Enter squash mode targeting the revision under cursor (in normal mode) or selected revisions (in visual mode)
- `<S-s>` - Quick squash the revision under cursor into its parent

Once in squash mode, the interface highlights your selection and the current squash destination:

- Selected changes are highlighted in your configured `selected_hl` color (default: dark magenta)
- The cursor position (potential squash destination) is highlighted in your configured `targeted_hl` color (default: green)
- Move the cursor to preview different squash destinations with live highlighting

From squash mode, choose how to squash:

- `<CR>` - Squash into (`-t`) the revision under cursor
- `<S-CR>` - Squash into (`-t`) ignoring immutability
- `<Esc>` or `<C-c>` - Exit squash mode without making changes

**Visual mode selection:** Select multiple revisions in visual mode before pressing `s` to squash them all at once. The plugin extracts each selected revision and squashes them together.

**Quick squash:** In normal mode, press `<S-s>` to quickly squash the current revision into its parent. This ignores immutability.

![Squash-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/squash.gif)

### Split changes from the log buffer

Split a change into two or more revisions directly from the log buffer or the command line:

- `<C-s>` - Split the revision under cursor from the log buffer

The split command opens an interactive floating terminal where jj guides you through selecting which changes go into the first commit. The remaining changes stay in the second commit.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use something like [hunk.nvim](https://github.com/julienvincent/hunk.nvim), simply follow the steps and update your jj's config to use it as a tool and a neovim instance with hunk will be ran inside your current neovim, for a seamless integration
>
> Other tools that ran in the terminal like jj's native should work out of the box too.

**Via `:J` command:**

```sh
:J split              " Split @ interactively
:J split abc123       " Split a specific revision
:J split @ --parallel " Create parallel changes instead of sequential
:J split @ --message "first half" " Set a commit message for the first split
```

**Via Lua API:**

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.split()                                      -- Split @ interactively
cmd.split({ rev = "abc123" })                    -- Split a specific revision
cmd.split({ parallel = true })                   -- Create parallel changes
cmd.split({ message = "first half" })            -- Set message for first split
cmd.split({ filesets = { "src/" } })             -- Only include specific filesets
cmd.split({ ignore_immutable = true })           -- Split an immutable revision
```

### Rebase changes from the log buffer

Enter an interactive rebase mode directly from the log buffer to rebase one or more changes:

- `r` - Enter rebase mode targeting the revision under cursor (in normal mode) or selected revisions (in visual mode)

Once in rebase mode, the interface highlights your selection and the current rebase destination:

- Selected changes are highlighted in your configured `selected_hl` color (default: dark magenta)
- The cursor position (potential rebase destination) is highlighted in your configured `targeted_hl` color (default: green)
- Move the cursor to preview different rebase destinations with live highlighting

From rebase mode, choose how to rebase:

- `<CR>` or `o` - Rebase onto (`-o`) the revision under cursor
- `a` - Rebase after (`-A`) the revision under cursor
- `b` - Rebase before (`-B`) the revision under cursor
- `<S-CR>` or `<S-o>` - Rebase onto (`-o`) ignoring immutability
- `<S-a>` - Rebase after (`-A`) ignoring immutability
- `<S-b>` - Rebase before (`-B`) ignoring immutability
- `<Esc>` or `<C-c>` - Exit rebase mode without making changes

**Visual mode selection:** Select multiple revisions in visual mode before pressing `r` to rebase them all at once. The plugin extracts each selected revision and rebases them together.

**Single revision:** In normal mode, place your cursor on a single revision and press `r` to rebase just that change.

![Rebase-from-log](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/rebase.gif)

### Open a PR/MR from the log buffer

- `o` - Open a PR/MR for the revision under cursor
- `<S-o>` - Select a remote from all available bookmarks and open a PR/MR

The plugin automatically:

- Extracts the bookmark from the revision
- Detects your git platform (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Forgejo, etc.)
- Constructs the appropriate PR/MR URL
- Handles both HTTPS and SSH remote URLs
- Prompts you to select a remote if you have multiple

**This is a jj.nvim exclusive feature** - the ability to seamlessly bridge from your Neovim jj workflow directly to your remote platform's PR/MR interface.

### Browse current file on remote

Open the current buffer's file in your browser on the hosted remote (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea/Forgejo, etc.) at the current cursor line or a visually selected range.

**Usage:**

```sh
:Jbrowse          " Use @ (best-effort chooses a remote-reachable ref)
:Jbrowse main     " Use an explicit revset (no walkback)
```

**How it works:**

- Takes the current buffer path and makes it repo-relative (must be inside a jj repo)
- Collects git remotes; if there's more than one, prompts you to pick one
- Normalizes the remote URL to an HTTPS base repo URL
- Picks a ref that is expected to exist on the remote:
  - With default `@`: walks back first-parent up to 20 parents to find a commit reachable from that remote's bookmarks; falls back to `trunk()` if needed
  - With an explicit revset (e.g. `main`, `@-2`): uses that revset directly (no walkback)
  - If there's a single unambiguous remote bookmark pointing at the chosen commit, uses that bookmark name; otherwise uses the commit SHA
- Builds a provider-specific URL and adds a line anchor:
  - GitHub-style: `#L<start>` or `#L<start>-L<end>`
  - GitLab-style: `#L<start>` or `#L<start>-<end>`

In Visual mode, select lines and run `:Jbrowse` to open a range.

### Open a changed file

Just press enter to open a file from the `status` output in your current window.
![Open-status](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/enter-status.gif)

### Restore a changed file

Press `<S-x>` on a file from the `status` output and that's it, it's restored.

![Restore-status](https://github.com/NicolasGB/jj.nvim/raw/main/assets/x-status.gif)

### Status picker (Snacks.nvim)

When using the [Snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) picker integration, `picker.status()` opens a fuzzy-findable list of changed files with a live diff preview. Available keybindings:

- `<Enter>` - Open the selected file
- `<C-d>` - Open the selected file and run `Jdiff`

## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

Using the latest stable release:

```lua
{
    "nicolasgb/jj.nvim",
    version = "*", -- Use latest stable release
    -- Or from the main branch (uncomment the branch line and comment the version line)
    -- branch = "main",
    config = function()
        require("jj").setup({})
    end,
}
```

## Cmdline Usage

The plugin provides a `:J` command that accepts jj subcommands:

```sh
:J status
:J log
:J describe "Your change description"
:J new
:J push               " Push all changes
:J push main         " Push only main bookmark
:J fetch             " Fetch from remote
:J open_pr           " Open PR for current change's bookmark
:J open_pr --list    " Select bookmark from all and open PR
:Jbrowse             " Open current file on remote at cursor line
:Jbrowse main        " Open current file on remote at the given revset
:J split             " Split a change interactively
:J diff_history      " Prompt for a `left..right` range and open a history-aware diff
:J diff_history main..@ " Open a history-aware diff between main and the working copy
:J bookmark create/move/delete/track/forget
:J tag set           " Set a tag (prompts for revision and tag name)
:J tag set abc123    " Set a tag on a specific revision
:J tag delete        " Delete a tag via picker
:J tag delete v1.0   " Delete a specific tag
:J # This will use your defined default command
:J <your-alias>
:J commit            " Opens your configured editor describes @ and then creates a new change -A immediately
:J commit <any text here> " Automatically describes @ and creates a new change -A immediately
```

### Diff Commands

The plugin also provides `:Jdiff`, `:Jvdiff`, and `:Jhdiff` commands for diffing against specific revisions:

```sh
:Jdiff              " Vertical diff against @- (parent)
:Jdiff @--          " Vertical diff against specific revision
:Jvdiff main        " Vertical diff against main bookmark
:Jhdiff trunk()     " Horizontal diff against trunk
```

### File Commands

Fugitive-inspired commands for viewing and editing files at specific jj revisions:

```sh
:Jread                   " Read current file at @ into current buffer (undoable)
:Jread main:src/init.lua " Read a file at a revision into the current buffer
:Jedit                   " Open current file at @ in the current window
:Jedit @--:%             " Open current file as it was at @--
:Jtabedit main:README.md " Open a file at a revision in a new tab
:Jsplit main:README.md   " Open a file at a revision in a horizontal split
:Jvsplit trunk():lua/jj/file.lua " Open a file at a revision in a vertical split
```

Target format is `<rev>:<path>`:

- `<rev>` is any valid jj revset (`@`, `main`, `@--`, `trunk()`, etc.)
- `<path>` can be `%` (current buffer file), repo-relative, or absolute
- If no argument is passed, defaults to `@:%`

The open commands (`:Jedit`, `:Jtabedit`, `:Jsplit`, `:Jvsplit`) create a `jj://<change_id>/<path>`
buffer. The revision expression is resolved to a stable change ID so the buffer name is unaffected
by bookmark movement. Mutable revisions are editable — `:w` writes the buffer back into the
revision via `jj diffedit`. Immutable revisions show an error on write.

## Default Config

```lua

      close = { "q", "<Esc>" },
      -- Floating buffer keymaps

        close = "q",                          -- Close floating buffer
        hide = "<Esc>",                       -- Hide floating buffer
      },
    },

}}

```

### Describe Editor Modes

The `describe.editor.type` option lets you choose how you want to write commit descriptions:

- **`"buffer"`** (default) - Opens a full buffer editor similar to Git's commit message editor
  - Shows file changes with syntax highlighting
  - Multi-line editing with proper formatting
  - Close with `q` or `<Esc>`, save with `:w` or `:wq`
- **`"input"`** - Simple single-line input prompt
  - Quick and minimal
  - Good for short, single-line descriptions
  - Uses `vim.ui.input()` which can be customized by UI plugins like dressing.nvim

Example:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  describe = {
    editor = {
      type = "input", -- Use simple input mode
    }
  }
})
```

You can also customize the keymaps for the describe editor buffer:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  describe = {
    editor = {
      type = "buffer",
      keymaps = {
        close = { "q", "<Esc>", "<C-c>" }, -- Customize close keybindings
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Editor Options

The top-level `editor` config controls behavior for the describe/commit editor buffers.

#### `editor.auto_insert`

When `auto_insert = true`, `jj.nvim` automatically enters Insert mode when opening a describe or commit buffer **only if the description is empty**.

If the change already has a description, the buffer stays in Normal mode so you can review or edit the existing message without being dropped straight into Insert mode.

Default:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  editor = {
    auto_insert = false,
  }
})
```

Enable smart auto-insert:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  editor = {
    auto_insert = true,
  }
})
```

#### `editor.window`

Control where the describe/commit editor buffer opens:

- `type`: `"hsplit" | "vsplit" | "floating" | "tab"`
- `split_size`: split ratio for `hsplit`/`vsplit` (default `0.5`)
- `floating_width`: width ratio for floating windows (default `0.99`)
- `floating_height`: height ratio for floating windows (default `0.95`)

Example:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  editor = {
    window = {
      type = "floating",
      floating_width = 0.9,
      floating_height = 0.8,
    },
  },
})
```

### Highlight Customization

The `highlights` option allows you to customize the colors used in the describe buffer's file status display. Each highlight accepts standard Neovim highlight attributes:

- `fg` - Foreground color (hex or color name)
- `bg` - Background color
- `ctermfg` - Terminal foreground color
- `ctermbg` - Terminal background color
- `bold`, `italic`, `underline` - Text styles

Example with custom colors:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  highlights = {
    modified = { fg = "#89ddff", bold = true },
    added = { fg = "#c3e88d", ctermfg = "LightGreen" },
  }
})
```

## Lua API Usage

Beyond the `:J` command, you can call functions directly from Lua for more control. The example config below shows how to use them with custom keymaps.

### Log Command Options

The `log` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.log({
  summary = false,      -- Show summary of changes (default: false)
  reversed = false,     -- Reverse the log order (default: false)
  no_graph = false,     -- Hide the graph (default: false)
  limit = 20,          -- Limit number of entries (default: 20)
  revisions = "'all()'" -- Revision specifier (default: all reachable)
})

-- Examples:
cmd.log({ limit = 50 })                    -- Show 50 entries
cmd.log({ revisions = "'main::@'" })       -- Show commits between main and current
cmd.log({ summary = true, limit = 100 })   -- Show summary with high limit
cmd.log({ raw = "-r 'main::@' --summary --no-graph" }) -- Pass raw flags directly
```

## Configuration Examples

### New Command Options

The `new` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.new({
  show_log = false,     -- Display log after creating new change (default: false)
  with_input = false,   -- Prompt for parent revision (default: false)
  args = ""             -- Additional arguments to pass to jj new
})

-- Examples:
cmd.new({ show_log = true })                           -- Create new and show log
cmd.new({ show_log = true, with_input = true })        -- Prompt for parent
cmd.new({ args = "--before @" })                       -- Pass custom args
```

### Push Command Options

The `push` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.push({
  bookmark = "main"     -- Push specific bookmark (default: all changes)
})

-- Examples:
cmd.push()                    -- Push all changes
cmd.push({ bookmark = "main" }) -- Push only main bookmark
cmd.push({ bookmark = "feature" }) -- Push only feature bookmark
```

### Bookmark Management Command Options

The `bookmark_create` function creates a new bookmark:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_create()                               -- Prompts for bookmark name, then prompts the revision
cmd.bookmark_create({ prefix = "feature/" })        -- Uses prefix for default bookmark name
```

You can also set a default bookmark prefix in the config:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  cmd = {
    bookmark = {
      prefix = "feature/"  -- Default prefix when creating bookmarks
    }
  }
})
```

The `bookmark_move` function moves an existing bookmark to a new revision:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_move()  -- Select bookmark, then specify new revset
```

The `bookmark_delete` function deletes a bookmark:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_delete()  -- Select bookmark to delete
```

The `bookmark_track` function tracks an untracked bookmark:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_track()  -- Select bookmark to track
```

The `bookmark_forget` function forgets a bookmark (untracks it locally):

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.bookmark_forget()  -- Select bookmark to forget/untrack
```

### Tag Management Command Options

The `tag_set` function creates a tag on a revision:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.tag_set()              -- Prompts for revision and tag name
cmd.tag_set("abc123")      -- Set a tag on a specific revision (prompts for tag name)
```

The `tag_delete` function deletes a tag via picker:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.tag_delete()           -- Select tag to delete from picker
```

The `tag_push` function pushes a tag to a remote (colocated repositories only):

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.tag_push()             -- Select tag to push from picker (prompts for remote if multiple)
```

### Open PR/MR Command Options

The `open_pr` function accepts an options table:

```lua
local cmd = require("jj.cmd")
cmd.open_pr({
  list_bookmarks = false    -- Whether to select from all bookmarks (default: false, uses current revision)
})

-- Examples:
cmd.open_pr()                          -- Open PR for current change's bookmark
cmd.open_pr({ list_bookmarks = true }) -- Select bookmark from all and open PR
```

### Diff Module

The diff module provides a unified API for viewing diffs with pluggable backend support.

The natively supported backends are:

- Native (Diffs the current file in place and uses a floating buffer with your jj diff command when diffing changes)
- [codediff](https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim)
- [diffview](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim)

#### Functions

```lua
local diff = require("jj.diff")

-- Diff current buffer against a revision (default: @-)
-- The `layout` is only supported for the native backend
diff.diff_current({ rev = "@-", layout = "vertical" })

-- Show what changed in a single revision
diff.show_revision({ rev = "abc123" })

-- Diff between two revisions
diff.diff_revisions({ left = "main", right = "@" })

-- Open a history-aware diff between two revisions
-- Supported by the `diffview` and `codediff` backends
-- The `native` backend currently warns instead
diff.diff_history_revisions({ left = "main", right = "@" })

-- Convenience functions (LEGACY FUNCTIONS)
diff.open_vdiff()                   -- Vertical split diff against parent
diff.open_vdiff({ rev = "main" })   -- Vertical split against specific revision
diff.open_hdiff()                   -- Horizontal split diff
diff.open_hdiff({ rev = "@-2" })    -- Horizontal split against @-2
```

#### Log Buffer Integration

The diff module integrates seamlessly with the log buffer:

- `<S-d>` - Show diff for the revision under cursor in a floating window
- `<S-h>` - In visual mode, open a history-aware diff for the first and last selected revisions

These actions use the configured diff backend, allowing you to leverage your preferred diff viewer directly from the log.

### Custom Diff Backends

The diff module supports pluggable backends. Built-in backends include `native`, `diffview`, and `codediff`. You can register your own backend:

```lua
local diff = require("jj.diff")

diff.register_backend("my-backend", {
  -- Diff current buffer against a revision
  diff_current = function(opts)
    -- opts.rev: revision to diff against (default: "@-")
    -- opts.path: file path (default: current buffer)
    -- opts.layout: "vertical" or "horizontal"
  end,

  -- Show what changed in a single revision
  show_revision = function(opts)
    -- opts.rev: revision to show
    -- opts.path: optional file filter
    -- opts.display: "floating", "tab", or "split"
  end,

  -- Diff between two revisions
  diff_revisions = function(opts)
    -- opts.left: left/base revision
    -- opts.right: right/target revision
    -- opts.path: optional file filter
    -- opts.display: "floating", "tab", or "split"
  end,

  -- Open a history-aware diff between two revisions
  diff_history_revisions = function(opts)
    -- opts.left: left/base revision
    -- opts.right: right/target revision
  end,
})
```

Set your backend as default in the config:

```lua
require("jj").setup({
  diff = {
    backend = "my-backend"
  }
})
```

Or use it per-call:

```lua
diff.diff_current({ backend = "my-backend", rev = "main" })
```

All four backend functions are optional—missing ones fall back to the `native` implementation.

### File Module

The file module provides file-at-revision workflows similar to Fugitive's `Gread`/`Gedit`.

```lua
local file = require("jj.file")

-- Read a file from a revision into the current buffer (undoable)
file.read_target({ rev = "main", path = "lua/jj/init.lua" })
file.read_target({ rev = "@--", path = "%" }) -- current file at @--

-- Open buffers at a given revision
file.open_target({ rev = "main", path = "README.md" })                -- current window (default)
file.open_target({ rev = "@", path = "%", split = "horizontal" })    -- split
file.open_target({ rev = "trunk()", path = "%", split = "vertical" }) -- vsplit
file.open_target({ rev = "@--", path = "%", split = "tab" })          -- new tab
```

`split` accepts: `"current"` (default), `"tab"`, `"horizontal"`, or `"vertical"`.

Annotate also works from `jj://` virtual buffers and resolves the revision and path automatically.

### Annotations

View file blame and line history using the annotate module. Can be invoked via command or Lua API.

**Via `:J` command:**

```sh
:J annotate         " Show blame/annotations for entire file in vertical split
:J annotate_line    " Show annotation for current line in floating buffer
:J annotate_virtual " Toggle virtual-text annotations for the current file
:J annotate_virtual first " Compact mode: show only first line per consecutive change
```

**Via Lua API:**

```lua
local annotate = require("jj.annotate")
annotate.file()    -- Show blame/annotations for entire file in vertical split
annotate.line()    -- Show annotation for current line in a tooltip
annotate.virtual() -- Toggle virtual-text annotations for the current file
```

The file annotation displays a vertical split showing:

- Change ID (colored uniquely per commit)
- Author name
- Timestamp

Press `<CR>` on any annotation line to view the diff for that change.

The line annotation displays a floating tooltip with the current line's annotation and the commit description.

The virtual annotation displays right-aligned virtual text on each source line by default. Pass `display = "first"` to only show the first line in each consecutive block from the same change.

Example keymaps:

```lua
local annotate = require("jj.annotate")
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ja", annotate.file, { desc = "JJ annotate file" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jA", annotate.line, { desc = "JJ annotate line" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jv", annotate.virtual, { desc = "JJ annotate virtual" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>jV", function()
  annotate.virtual({ display = "first" })
end, { desc = "JJ annotate virtual compact" })
```

## Example config

```lua

{
  "nicolasgb/jj.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "folke/snacks.nvim", -- Optional, only needed if you use pickers

    -- One of these two if you want to use them as your diff backend
    "esmuellert/codediff.nvim",
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
  },

  config = function()
    local jj = require("jj")
    jj.setup({
      terminal = {
        cursor_render_delay = 10, -- Adjust if cursor position isn't restoring correctly
      },

          backend = "codediff"
      },

          }
        },
        bookmark = {
            prefix = "feat/"
        },
